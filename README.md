 These are some small projects I made using JavaScript.

 ## Projects
 - [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/Jose-Hernandez-Jr/JavaScript-Project/tree/main/Pizza_Project)
 - [Tic Tac Toe]()
 - [Calculator](https://github.com/Jose-Hernandez-Jr/JavaScript-Project/blob/main/calculator.html)

   ## Pizza Menu
   This project is a menu used to order pizza with various selection of toppings. It takes the input and caluclates the price for the order.

   ## Tic Tac Toe
   This is the classic game, that randomly rolls the dice to select which of the two players goes first and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

## Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a web version of a calculator.
